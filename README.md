# **Requirement Analysis in Software Development**

This repository explores the concept of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  
It explains the importance, key activities, and practical examples to help understand how requirements are defined, documented, and validated in real-world projects.


## **What is Requirement Analysis?**

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It ensures that the software product being developed aligns with business goals and user needs.  
In the SDLC, requirement analysis acts as the foundation upon which design, development, and testing are built.

## **Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

1. *Clarity and Understanding* – Prevents miscommunication by ensuring all stakeholders share the same vision.  
2. *Reduced Costs* – Early identification of requirements minimizes costly changes later in development.  
3. *Better Project Planning* – Provides a clear scope, making timelines and resources easier to manage.

## **Key Activities in Requirement Analysis**
- *Requirement Gathering* – Collecting needs from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- *Requirement Elicitation* – Extracting and refining requirements using techniques like brainstorming or prototyping.  
- *Requirement Documentation* – Writing clear, structured requirement specifications.  
- *Requirement Analysis and Modeling* – Studying requirements to detect conflicts, gaps, or ambiguities, and representing them in models/diagrams.  
- *Requirement Validation* – Ensuring requirements meet stakeholder needs and align with project goals.

## **Types of Requirements**

### Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do.  
*Examples for Booking Management System*:
- Users can search for available rooms.  
- The system allows customers to make, modify, and cancel bookings.  
- An email confirmation is sent after booking.  

### Non-functional Requirements
These describe how the system should perform.  
*Examples for Booking Management System*:
- The system should handle 500 concurrent users.  
- Page load times must not exceed 3 seconds.
- The system must comply with GDPR for user data protection.

## **Use Case Diagrams**

Use Case Diagrams visualize the interaction between actors (users or systems) and use cases (functions).  
They help in understanding *who interacts with the system* and *what functionality is expected*.  

**Booking System Use Case**

## **Acceptance Criteria**

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions a feature must meet to be accepted as complete.  
They ensure requirements are *testable and unambiguous*.  

*Example – Checkout Feature in Booking Management System:*  
- The system should allow the user to review their booking summary before payment.  
- The system must securely process payments through the integrated gateway.  
- A confirmation page with booking details must be displayed after successful payment.
- An email receipt must be sent to the customer.


## **Conclusion**

This repository provides a structured overview of *Requirement Analysis* in software development, highlighting its importance, key activities, and practical examples.  
The use case diagram illustrates real interactions between actors and system functions, giving a clear picture of system behavior.  

By following these practices, teams can ensure clearer communication, reduce risks, and improve the quality of software development projects.
